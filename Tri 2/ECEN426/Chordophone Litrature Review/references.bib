  abstract = {The Faculty of Engineering at Victoria University of
Wellington has constructed a robotic bass guitar player, Bassbot.
A critical feature of such a robot is the plucking mechanism.
Three mechanisms were made, two using stepper motors of
differing sizes and one using two pull type solenoids. These were
compared based on metrics of speed and consistency. There was
trade-offs between the systems, with the most consistent being the
slowest and the fastest system being the least consistent. To
expand the abilities of the robot, a height adjusting cam was
added to one of the stepper motors to allow dynamic playing.},

  abstract   = {Since the earliest times, humans have sought the ability to produce rhythms and tones using devices external to the human body. As technology developed, so too did the desire for this sound production to become automated. Initially peaking around the Industrial Revolution, traditional automated musical production devices went into a steep decline with the arrival of the phonograph. However, factors such as the ubiquitous acceptance of the microcontroller led to a resurgent interest in this field. This paper investigates the design considerations and development of the stringed chordophone and specifically the guitar. The challenge is to produce a mechatronic device capable of speedy and reliable note selection, string actuation, string damping and expressiveness. In the same manner that there is not one best way to play a guitar and no best guitar design, so too is there no “best” chordophone design. Rather, the competing factors of speed, precision, reliability, portability, expressiveness and timbral variation can be given different weightings and result in different designs. Therefore, rather than presenting a single chordophone development, this paper provides a multitude of design options providing an interested reader with the background and suggestions to create their own bespoke design. This paper concludes with the presentation of the authors' final design as an integration of the presented ideas and design techniques. We demonstrate that this chordophone introduces expressivity at a level not achieved before, is modular yet portable, is mechanically quiet and can play at a speed beyond that of even the best human player.},

This new chordophone has been developed to offer enhanced dynamic range, fast picking speeds, fast pitch shifter displacement, and additional expressive techniques compared to existing systems.},

A guitar pick is antagonistically loaded with two inflatable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) actuators, allowing for the independent control of both position or stiffness through the utilization of one and two PDMS solenoids, respectively. To generate smooth analog pressure signals, the bellows incorporate a controlled leak to atmospheric pressure, having synonymous properties to a low-pass filter circuit when fed a coarse pressure signal through PWM control. Experimental results illustrate a minimum to maximum stiffness range of 76 to 320 Nmm/rad, a maximum cyclical speeds of 2.04 Hz, and a stiffness change rate of 96 Nmm/rad/kPa. Additional to the VSA, alternative PDMS fabrication methods are presented to allow for complex, precise manufacturing of silicone bodies in a low-cost manner.},

We discuss existing solutions to accessible musical instruments, followed by the results of an online survey of bass guitarists, which informed the design of a prototype bass guitar adaptation. The adaptation comprises a foot-operated MIDI controller with a solenoid-actuated fretting mechanism, providing access to six frets across two strings of the bass. A study involving six bassists rehearsing and writing a bass guitar accompaniment with the adapted bass highlighted unexpected facets of bass guitar playing, and provided insights into the design of future accessible string instruments.},
  comment   = {Smehwat novel design for damping. However, it is designed for an acoustic guitair so there is littler considerations for the noise that may be gernated by theactuator for this system. Although, becuase this system is actuated by solenoids rather than stepper motors it may not be as much of an issue.

Interesting as it's designed for disabilty as well},
